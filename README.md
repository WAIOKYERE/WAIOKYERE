## About me ðŸ˜Ž


ðŸ”­I am dedicated to improving my web development skills and actively seek opportunities to contribute to meaningful open-source projects.     
ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm learning more about complex JavaScript frameworks like React and Node.js.
In addition, I am actively working on grasping backend technologies through an Udemy course.  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative web development projects and community-driven tech initiatives.               
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development trends, front-end frameworks, and building user-friendly web applications.
